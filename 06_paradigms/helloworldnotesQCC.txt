//type this in the console looking racket or the top half of Dr.Racket

Netlogo
"Hello, World!" 
//Type this in the observer

Python
print("Hello, World!")
//this is the code

-All have  " " around hello world
-Python requires ("   ") and not only "  "
-couldn't really find any other noticeable things
